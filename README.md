I have chosen the US Domestic flights dataset from one of the links given in "Where to find Data?"

It is from GitHub Awesome Public Datasets in the Transportation category at https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets

This Dataset is 270MB and the maximum file I can upload on GitHub is 25MB. So, it cannot be uploaded to my GitHub repository.

Please access my dataset at
